# RAG-Document-QA
The RAG Document QA project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that allows users to upload documents and ask AI-powered questions. The system utilizes OpenAI's GPT model along with Supabase for document storage and retrieval.

This project is designed to enable users to:

Upload documents (text-based)

Generate embeddings using OpenAI

Store embeddings in Supabase for vector search

Ask questions based on the uploaded documents

Get AI-generated responses using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo

 Features
